# Required tools

1. Download and install conda or mamba.
2. Build python environment from `environment.yml`. This is supplied by the python package `goes2go` and gets necessary tech for that.
3. The `environment_spec.yml` is a little more specific with package versions, but also might not be portable to different systems.
4. Install R version 4.4.0 or higher. Add the Rscript.exe to your path.
5. Run `setup.R` to install requisite packages.
6. Run all the steps in `procedure.sh`.
