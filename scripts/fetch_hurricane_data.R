# Structure is as follows
# There are header lines with the storm ID (1-8), name (19-28), and number of rows of data for the storm (34-36).

# The data lines are structured as follows:
# 20210829, 1655, L, HU, 29.1N, 90.2W, 130, 931, 130, 110, 80, 110, 70, 60, 40, 60, 45, 35, 20, 30, 10

# 2021 (Spaces 1-4) – Year
# 08 (Spaces 5-6) – Month
# 29 (Spaces 7-8, before 1st comma) – Day
# 16 (Spaces 11-12) – Hours in UTC (Universal Time Coordinate)
# 55 (Spaces 13-14, before 2nd comma) – Minutes
# L (Space 17, before 3rd comma) – Record identifier (see notes below)
# C – Closest approach to a coast, not followed by a landfall
# G – Genesis
# I – An intensity peak in terms of both pressure and wind
# L – Landfall (center of system crossing a coastline)
# P – Minimum in central pressure
# R – Provides additional detail on the intensity of the cyclone when rapid changes are underway
# S – Change of status of the system
# T – Provides additional detail on the track (position) of the cyclone
# W – Maximum sustained wind speed
# HU (Spaces 20-21, before 4th comma) – Status of system. Options are:
#     TD – Tropical cyclone of tropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
# TS – Tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity (34-63 knots)
# HU – Tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity (> 64 knots)
# EX – Extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
# SD – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
# SS – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical storm intensity (> 34 knots)
# LO – A low that is neither a tropical cyclone, a subtropical cyclone, nor an extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
# WV – Tropical Wave (of any intensity)
# DB – Disturbance (of any intensity)
# 29.1 (Spaces 24-27) – Latitude
# N (Space 28, before 5th comma) – Hemisphere – North or South
# 90.2 (Spaces 31-35) – Longitude
# W (Space 36, before 6th comma) – Hemisphere – West or East
# 130 (Spaces 39-41, before 7th comma) – Maximum sustained wind (in knots)
